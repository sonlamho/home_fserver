# Instructions for flake8 and mypy:
# - before using flake8 and mypy, first do `pip install -r app/python/requirements_devtest3.txt`
# - flake8 is for checking python syntax and enforcing python style.
#   flake8 can be used right away with this setup.cfg file in place.
# - mypy is for static type checking
#   to use mypy, you must first clone these repos to your user home directory:
#   + https://github.com/sonlamho/typeshed
#   + https://github.com/sonlamho/pandas-stubs

#Mypy supports reading configuration settings from a file. By default it uses the file mypy.ini with fallback to setup.cfg in the current directory, then $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mypy/config, then ~/.config/mypy/config, and finally .mypy.ini in the user home directory if none of them are found
